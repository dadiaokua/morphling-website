# Job MetaData Persistency


Kubernetes api-server typically stores job information for a limited lifespan. KubeDL has built-in support to persist the
job metadata into external storage to outlive api-server state.
The KubeDL controller will persist the job metadata during the lifecycle of job such as job and pod creation/deletion.

Currently, only `Mysql` is supported.

## DB Schema

### Job Table

| **Column**   |   **Type**    |   **Description**   |
|------------- |-------------|--------------|
| id | int(64) | primary id auto incremented by underlying database |
| name | varchar(128) | name of job |
| namespace | varchar(128) | namespace of job |
| job_id | varchar(64) | job uid generated by kubernetes |
| version | varchar(32) | resource version generated by kubernetes(etcd) |
| status | varchar(32) | current observed job status(Created/Running/Failed/Succeed/Restarting) |
| kind | varchar(32) | kind of job: TFJob,PyTorchJob... |
| resources | text | job requested resources, including replicas and resources of each role. |
| deploy_region | varchar(64) | deploy_region indicates the physical region(IDC) this job located in, reserved for jobs running in across-region-clusters |
| tenant | varchar(255) | fields reserved for multi-tenancy job management scenarios, indicating which tenant this job belongs to and who's the owner(user) |
| owner | varchar(255) | owner of job |
| is_in_etcd | tinyint(4) | is_in_etcd indicates that whether record of this job has been removed from etcd |
| gmt_created | datetime |  timestamp when job created |
| gmt_modified | datetime | timestamp when last job status transited |
| gmt_finished | datetime | timestamp when job failed or succeed |

### Pod Table

| **Column**   |   **Type**    |   **Description**   |
|------------- |-------------|-----------------|
| id | int(64) | primary id auto incremented by underlying database |
| name | varchar(128) | name of pod |
| namespace | varchar(128) | namespace of pod |
| pod_id | varchar(64) | pod uid generated by kubernetes |
| version | varchar(32) | resource version generated by kubernetes(etcd) |
| status | varchar(32) | current observed pod phase(Pending/Running/Failed/Succeed/Unkown) |
| image | varchar(255) | image name of main conatiner |
| job_id | varchar(64) | job id of this pod controlled by |
| replica_type | varchar(32) | replica type of this pod belongs to |
| resources | varchar(1024) | resources this pod requested, marshaled from a ResourceRequirements object |
| host_ip | varchar(64) | ip of the host this pod scheduled |
| pod_ip | varchar(64) | ip of this pod allocated |
| deploy_region | varchar(64) | deploy_region indicates the physical region(IDC) this job located in |
| is_in_etcd | tinyint(4) | is_in_etcd indicates that whether record of this job has been removed from etcd |
| remark | text | extended messaged for pod |
| gmt_created | datetime |  timestamp when pod created |
| gmt_modified | datetime | timestamp when last pod status transited |
| gmt_started | datetime | timestamp when main container stared |
| gmt_finished | datetime | timestamp when pod failed or succeed |


## How To Use
Below is an example to setup KubeDL to use `Mysql` as the persistency DB.

1. Set up credentials for KubeDL to connect to DB. Create a `Secret` object like below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kubedl-mysql-config
  namespace: kubedl-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  host: my.host.com
  dbName: kubedl
  user: kubedl-user
  password: this-is-me
  port: "3306"
```

2. Update the Kubedl Deployment spec to include `--meta-storage mysql` in the startup flag and reference the DB credentials
via environment variables. The KubeDL controller uses the env to set up connection with DB.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kubedl
  namespace: kubedl-system
  labels:
    app: kubedl
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubedl
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kubedl
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: kubedl/kubedl:v0.3.0
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: kubedl-manager
        args:
        - "--meta-storage"
        - "mysql"
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_HOST
          value:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kubedl-mysql-config
              key: host
        - name: MYSQL_DB_NAME
          value:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kubedl-mysql-config
              key: dbName
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kubedl-mysql-config
              key: user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kubedl-mysql-config
              key: password
```


## MySql Config
The configs defined in the aforementioned `secret`:

| Config Name   |   Description    |
|------------- |-------------|
| host | Mysql host name |
| dbName | DB name|
| user | User name|
| password | User password|
| port | The mysql DB port to connect to |
